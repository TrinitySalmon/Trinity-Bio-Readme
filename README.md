# Trinity-Bio-Readme

Hello, my name is Trinity Salmon, and I'm a 17-year-old with a passion for technology and making a positive impact. 
With a strong background in fundraising and community support, I've been involved in various initiatives that aim to make a difference in people's lives. 

By learning to use GitHub, I hope to enhance my skills in collaboration and project management within the tech community. My goal is to leverage this platform to develop and share 
resources, tools, and programs, as well as to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to impactful projects. 
Through GitHub, I aim to expand my knowledge and make meaningful contributions to the tech world.
